The company works on all types of metal  and carbon fibre.  Clients include companies in Power Generation, Chemical, Petro Chemical and Nuclear industries.   Work in the Nuclear Industry is, typically, heat treatment of pipe welds and this work accounts for less than 1% of Turnover. Thermal Hire Ltd.. does a maximum of 20 man days per year within the containment area. The company works on Offshore Oil and Gas Rigs and the insured estimates that this will be approximately 1,000 man days in the coming year.  They have employees with Offshore Training and Certification. Work is principally in the North Sea and Irish Sea but they have worked in Malta and Angola. Maximum 12 men offshore at any one time, maximum 6 men on any Offshore installation. Work includes decommissioning where Thermal heats metal which is then welded to the structure of the installation, by another Contractor, so that nothing falls when the rig is lifted out of the water. They have an increasing involvement with work on oil rigs in dockyards both on dry land and afloat tied up at the quayside. This work may extend to rigs anchored in 
bays. They have undertaken work on a Rig moored in Alexandria, Egypt. The company has also worked on ships usually in Dry Dock or tied up alongside and have also worked on Drilling Ships but these were always anchored and operating. Thermal has not undertaken any of this work in the past couple of years but will do so again if the opportunity 
arises. They have worked on Submarines for British Aerospace, always in assembly halls, never afloat. In 2008 the client started manufacturing items for their own use and for sale. Basically they buy in components 
and assemble items such as transformers and consumables such as elements for use in Heat Treatment. As well as this they also buy in items to sell on. All products manufactured are CE marked. Items are currently imported from China, India, Japan and Hungary although the list is subject to frequent change.   Imports estimated at approx £300,000 in the coming year. The company does not provide Thermographics. 
The company purchased an Engineering company in 2018. It produces steel anchors for refractories and operates in the new building at Wigan described below. No separate trading name. Thermal Hire Ltd have recently purchased a Company called Clarian UK Ltd which is now  operating as a wholly owned subsidiary out of the Wigan premises. Clarian UK ltd is a wholesaler of electrical components such as heaters, heating elements, safety relays, safety switches, relay boxes, circuit breakers, temperature sensors and cable management boxes.
